Sittler operates several mobile tub grinding units which serve to manufacture many different size mulch products, with many uses. Land clearing materials, stump grinding, yard trimmings, stumps, and leaves can be reduced to produce mulch products. Sittler has many years of experience in providing custom tub grinding services.  Sittler currently has municipal contracts as well as private contractors as clients. We work on long-term contracts or one time lump sum and unit priced contracts.

Our mobility, on site efficiency and safety add to reduce our client’s liability of having subcontractors on your sites for extended periods time.

We are self sufficient on site, and our experienced crews come with large equipment to make the job look easy.  Stumps are gone in seconds!

Why does big equipment matter? When our crews are finished, the stockpiles are massive in comparison to most mulching units. This leaves our customers not having to consolidate piles and their space is conserved.

We will grind to many different sizes. Our equipment is equipped with cross belt continuous magnetic separators, removing the ferrous contaminates.

For construction wood and demolition material which are collected in landfills, we provide a coarse grind size product. As well as size and volume reduction, this product will become more compact, spreadable, and ultimately can be used as an Alternative Daily Cover (ADC).

The photo below shows the orderly fashion in which the mulched compost is neatly stockpiled after mulching.
